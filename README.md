Once you have that on your clipboard navigate to VS Code and run 'git clone ____' and paste the link in after that. Once you have that done make sure you CD into the correct directory and run "node index.js" and you can make your own employee cards!

## Usage

This application can be used to write and store employee information for easy access. Both emails and GitHub usernames are functioning hyper links so it makes collaborating really easy! Have a question for a teammate? Want to see what they are working on? Just click the corresponding link in their employee card!
